### **How It Began:**

In the summer of 2024, I met **Prof. Paul Ronney**, chair of the USC Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering department, and joined his lab working with one of his PhD students. This was my first step into the **Combustion Physics Lab**. That fall, I had the chance to attend the **APS Gaseous Electronics Conference (San Diego, 2024)**, where I was first introduced to the world of plasma physics.  

One year later, I came back with my *own* results â€” presenting a poster at the **14th U.S. National Combustion Meeting (Boston, 2025)**. This journey from observer to contributor shaped not just my technical skills, but also my passion for bridging **plasma physics and combustion science**. 

### **What I Worked On:**  
- **Particle-In-Cell (PIC) Simulations** â†’ Captured transient sheath formation, charge separation, oscillations, and non-equilibrium plasma phenomena that fluid models miss.  
- **Custom Python 1D PIC Code** â†’ Applied a 20 kV / 10 ns pulse across electrodes to study sheath growth, ion/electron transport, and plasma oscillations.  
- **Monte Carlo Collisions** â†’ Modeled ionization and electron-neutral momentum exchange.  
- **Starfish (2D PIC/MHD code)** â†’ Extended to body-fitted reactor geometries, simulating a spherical well-mixed chamber.  


### **Key Insights:**  
- Uncovered how **nanosecond pulse** optimizes ionization efficiency and plasma uniformity.  
- Visualized transient sheath and charge separation dynamics critical to plasma-assisted ignition.  
- Connected simulation findings to the design of next-gen plasma-assisted reactors.  


### **Conference Highlights:**  

- **APS Gaseous Electronics Conference (San Diego, CA, Sep 30 - Oct 4, 2024)** â€“ First exposure to the American Physical community.  
- **U.S. National Combustion Meeting (Boston, MA, March 16â€“19, 2025)** â€“ Presented my poster showcasing simulation results.
