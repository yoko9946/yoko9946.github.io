## Overview
This project retrofitted a **Cessna 310R** with a **hybrid-electric distributed propulsion system**, designed to maintain original range, speed, and payload capacity while introducing significant improvements in efficiency and emissions. The work was completed as part of a graduate-level aerospace engineering program, focusing on practical integration of advanced propulsion concepts into existing airframes.

## Objectives
- Maintain original aircraft performance metrics (range, speed, power, MTOW, payload).
- Demonstrate feasibility of integrating distributed hybrid-electric propulsion.
- Reduce operating costs and carbon emissions.


## Design Baseline

- Reconfigured from 2 internal combustion engines â†’ **4 Rotax 916 iSc A + 2 scaled electric motors**.
- Six propellers sized to fit along the wingspan, reduced diameter (1.4m) to accommodate spacing.
- Center of gravity maintained within safe margins (37.2% MAC vs original 35.9%).

## Analyses
- **Power:** 444 kW (modified) vs 440 kW (original), preserving output.
- **Aerodynamics:** Lift-to-drag ratio improved from 13 â†’ 18.5, enhancing range efficiency.
- **Mass/Emissions:** COâ‚‚ reduced from 831 kg â†’ 525 kg per flight; MTOW unchanged at 2495 kg.
- **Operating Costs:** Estimated reduction from $308/hr â†’ $125/hr.

## Results
- All design requirements were satisfied:
  - Range: 1100 km (unchanged).
  - Cruise speed: 98 m/s (unchanged).
  - Power output: preserved.
  - Cargo/passenger capacity: preserved.
- Achieved reduced emissions and flight-hour operating costs.

## Conclusion
The hybrid-electric Cessna 310R design illustrates how **sustainable aviation technologies** can be successfully integrated into existing platforms. It meets performance requirements, reduces emissions, and positions hybrid-electric systems as a realistic step toward greener, short-range business travel.
