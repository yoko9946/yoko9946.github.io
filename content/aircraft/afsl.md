## Technical Work
- Designed a **nonlinear 6-DOF aircraft dynamics model** based on Research Civil Aircraft Model (RCAM) framework.
- Represented attitude using **Euler angles** and **quaternions** for simulation accuracy.  
- Applied **state-space modeling** and **numerical optimization** for trimming and stability analysis.  
- Developed simulation and visualization pipelines using **MATLAB, Simulink, joystick hardware, Simulink 3D Animation, and FlightGear**.
