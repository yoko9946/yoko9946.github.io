Hi everyone, I’m Carrie Lai. My journey through aerospace has been grounded in physics and shaped by simulation-driven work in fluid and plasma dynamics as well as rocket propulsion systems. During my M.S. in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Southern California, I focused on computational modeling, where I deepened my expertise in Python and C++, developing simulation tools and numerical models to study complex fluid and plasma behavior in both space and combustion systems. This summer, I join a NASA-funded research project at the University of Michigan, where I help process large-scale particle data from the NASA Pleiades Supercomputer to simulate electron velocity distributions associated with Bursty Bulk Flows (~10 minutes, ~400 km/s) in the magnetotail region of Earth’s magnetosphere.

My early work on 2U and 6U CubeSat systems, UAV design for AIAA’s Design, Build, Fly competition, and control system modeling for autonomous aircraft at the University of Washington laid the groundwork for my foundation in fluid dynamics, control systems, and orbital mechanics.

I feel incredibly lucky to have explored so many domains of aerospace. Each experience has taught me to think in systems, adapt quickly, and stay curious across disciplines.

I recently earned my M.S. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Southern California, where I focused on plasma physics, computational modeling, and aerospace system design.

I’ve developed plasma simulations for both space and combustion environments, working with Particle-in-Cell (PIC) and fluid-based models. My work also extends to aircaft and rocket design, including CubeSats, electric aircraft, and both solid and liquid propulsion systems.

In Summer 2025, I joined a NASA-funded research project at the University of Michigan, where I helped model geomagnetic storm trajectories using the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF). Prior to that, I led plasma-assisted combustion simulations at USC and contributed to presentations at the GEC and USNCM conferences.

Outside of research, I enjoy music, ancient philosophy, and exploring the unseen forces that shape the world. I’m always looking for ways to connect science with a deeper sense of purpose.
