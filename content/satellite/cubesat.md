I was part of the University of Washington’s CubeSat Team, where I contributed to two space missions. These projects gave me the chance to work on cubesat design and analysis, with each mission deepening my experience in areas like guidance, navigation, control, and mission analysis.

- **GNC Team Lead for the Maratus Mission (6U CubeSat, 2020–2021, Capstone Project):**  
  As GNC Team Lead, I guided the development of the spacecraft’s guidance, navigation, and controls (GNC) architecture. The work involved defining mission objectives, authoring the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and modeling environmental disturbance torques such as atmospheric drag, gravity gradient, and solar radiation pressure. These analyses informed the integration of actuators and sensors into an Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) designed to maintain stable orientation and manage angular momentum throughout the mission.

- **Communications Engineer for the SOC-i Mission (2U CubeSat, 2020, NASA CSLI):**  
  I also worked on the SOC-i mission as a Communications Engineer. This 2U CubeSat was one of only 18 selected for NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative (https://www.nasa.gov/missions/small-satellite-missions/nasas-elana-43-prepares-for-firefly-aerospace-launch/). My role focused on simulating ground pass statistics across different orbital altitudes and inclinations, analyzing contact durations and frequencies. These simulation results helped inform our communications system design. You can check out the project’s code and repos on [GitHub – A&A CubeSat Team](https://github.com/AA-CubeSat-Team).
